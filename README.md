# Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

This project is a weather dashboard that uses the [openweathermap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to display current weather from a search, as well as a 5 day forecast.

It is designed to help travellers and common commuters to plan around upcoming weather reports.
